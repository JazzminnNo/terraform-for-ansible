# terraform-for-ansible
Shows a simple setup with Terraform for creating and provisioning servers for Ansible.

For running these terraform files, make sure you use a primary SSH key that does not require a passphrase, otherwise the local provisioner which executes the Ansible playbook cannot be run.
